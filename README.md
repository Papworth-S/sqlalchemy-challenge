# sqlalchemy-challenge
Complete the both the juypter notebook portion and the flask API app with help from Bing AI and AskBCS and where it was done should be in the comments throughout the code.


Creating the API app the dynamic portion might not be what was asked for. <br>
Also I treid to add some error encasing into the code but it was not asked for and was taking way to much time to figure out so I removed that bit of code which was a bit of for and if loops.  I didn't like it at all. <br>


In the sqlalchemy-challenge folders there are some extra folder and fiels which were used to run some test code/scripts. and a backup folder for additional versoin control.

For the API app the home page describes how to enter the date.  I don't have any error catching so there is that.
